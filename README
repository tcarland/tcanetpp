@section overview Overview:

   The 'tcanetpp' library is C++ library for providing core
networking functionality with an object-oriented interface. The 
library is a collection of utility classes that are not all 
necessarily networking specific, but are included for convenience.

   The library has been used in production software and has been 
refined over many years. At the heart, it provides an Object-
Oriented Socket class that wraps the Standard Library socket 
functions as well as Winsock2, providing a cross-platform 
implementation. 

    The general goal of the library is to provide core network 
functionality based completely on berkely sockets, libc, and 
libstdc++, with no other dependencies (with the exception of 
pthreads for the Thread-related classes).

The library provides the following additional functionality: 
  Containers: patricia/radix tree, hashmap, circular buffer, 
    synchronized queue.
  An event management class for handling both network I/O 
    and sub-second timers, 
  An Object-Oriented interface for pthreads and pthread mutexes.
  IP functions for manipulating IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses,
  A thread-safe logging facility,
  Network Device objects for management purposes.

    The library has few external dependencies outside of libc. The 
project can build individual libraries consisting of just the 
sub-components, or a single, encompassing lib of 'libtcanetpp'. 
The pthreads library is only needed for the Thread related classes. 


@section docs Documentation:
  The library is being documented in an API format via doxygen. 
Run 'make documentation' to generate the docs (doxygen req.)


@section build Build:

Unix:
  Uses tcamake build environment to set dependencies for simply 
running 'make'. The library links only libpthread and libdl.
  (+libsocket and libnsl for SunOS) 

Win32/64:
  Visual studio project files should be provided for win32 support
(only the thread classes are unsupported with windows and are not 
compiled; The win32 pthread library may be compatible, but ymmv).
