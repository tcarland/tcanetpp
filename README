@section overview Overview:

   The 'tcanetpp' library is C/C++ library for providing core
networking functionality with an object-oriented interface. The 
library is a collection of utility classes that are not all 
necessarily networking specific, but are included for convenience.

   The library has been used and refined for many years and at its 
heart provides an Object-Oriented Socket class that wraps the core 
stdlib socket functions as well as Winsock2 providing a 
cross-platform implementation. The goal of the overall library, is 
to provide core network functionality based soley on berkely sockets,
libc, and libstdc++, with no other external dependencies (with the 
exception of pthreads for the Thread-related classes).

Additional classes that are provided include: 
    containters, (patricia/radix tree, hashmap, a circular buffer),
    an event library, 
    an Object-Oriented interface for pthreads, 
    CIDR functions for manipulating IP Addresses,
    a thread-safe logging facility,
    network device management.

The library has few external dependencies outside of libc. The project can
build individual libraries consisting of just the sub-components, or a 
single, encompassing lib of 'libtcanetpp'. The pthreads library is used for 
the Thread classes. 

@section docs Documentation:
  The library is being documented in an API format via doxygen. 
Run 'make documentation' to generate the docs (doxygen req.)

@section build Build:

*nix:
  Uses tcamake build environment to set dependencies for simply running
'make'. The library links only libpthread and libdl (+libsocket and libnsl
with 'SunOS_sun4u'). 

Win32/64:
  Visual studio project files should be provided for win32 support
(only the thread classes are iffy with windows and are not compiled 
under win32 (the win32 pthread library may be compatible, but ymmv)
