Overview:

   The 'tcanetpp' library is C/C++ library for providing core
networking functionality with an object-oriented interface. The 
library is a collection of utility classes that are not all 
necessarily networking specific, but are included for convenience.

   The library has been used and refined for many years and at its 
heart provides an Object-Oriented Socket class that wraps the core 
stdlib socket functions as well as Winsock2 providing a 
cross-platform implementation.

Additional utilities that are provided include: 
    a few containters, (patricia and hashmap),
    an event library, 
    a versatile circular buffer,
    an Object-Oriented interface for pthreads, 
    Cidr tools for manipulating IP Addresses,
    a thread-safe logging facility,
    NetworkDevice mapping.

The library has no external dependencies outside of libc. The project can
build individual libraries consisting of just the sub-components, or a 
single, encompassing lib or 'libtcanetpp'.

Documentation:
  The library is being documented in an API format via doxygen. 
Run 'make documentation' to generate the docs (doxygen req.)

Build:

*nix:
  Uses tcamake build environment to set dependencies for simply running
'make'. The library links only libpthread and libdl (+libsocket and libnsl
with 'SunOS_sun4u'). 

Win32/64:
  Visual studio project files should be provided for 
win32 support (only the thread classes are iffy with windows and are not 
compiled in under win32 (win32 pthread library may be compatible, but is 
currently untested.)
